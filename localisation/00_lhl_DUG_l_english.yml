 POLITICS_PHILOSOPHER_KING_DESC:0 "§YBirth name:§!§W Unknown§!\n\n§YLore:§!§W And so, at the head stands the Philosopher King, who, accordingly, represents a being with no personality of its own. The Philosopher King, a philosophical Tsar, is essentially no different from the embodiment of this personal Angel. The king is both an Angel and the whole people. He is a true person, superior to both the individual and the collective or society. \n\nThe Philosopher King must be hidden. Moreover, his existence must be so intense that it transcends the limits of existence. He will act in not-acting (the Taoist ideal of the perfect ruler is he who performs inaction, or Wu-Wei). Considering his deep and profound connection to the apophatic, he will be inexistent in existing or, on the contrary, he will exist in not existing. The Philosopher King is as if he was not, and he is not as he is. He should be easy, transparent, always open to the abyss represented by him in the Tcardom. Perhaps he will communicate with his subjects from behind a curtain, from the depths of a cave, or even through an oracle. He should neither speak nor be silent, but instead only give signs. The Philosopher King operates with subtle signs, in semi-silence and soft regal whisper, as the meaning is transmitted as directly as the spirit blows.\n\n He is absolutely transparent, devoid of any individual properties. The personal in him should be so minute that it would be preferable to conceal everything reminiscent of it, including his body and his image. It would be better if no one could see the Philosopher King as something external. All should recognize him as an internal ruler, as the “guest within.”§!"
